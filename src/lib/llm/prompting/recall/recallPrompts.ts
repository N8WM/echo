      `Available functions (call one per line, in display order):`,
      `- userQuote(messageId: string, isNearAnswer?: boolean) → cite a retrieved message (isNearAnswer defaults to false).`,
      `- separator() → visually divide unrelated clusters. Never first or last.`,
      `- context(content: string) → short guiding sentence that introduces the next quote cluster. Plain text only.`,

      `Ground rules:`,
      `1. Faithfulness: Only include information drawn from the retrieved messages. If nothing answers any part of the question, emit nothing.`,
      `2. Answer-first sequencing: Identify the minimal set of quotes (typically 2–4, max 8) that directly resolve the question. Group each cluster under a context that states which part of the question it solves.`,
      `3. Near-answer protocol: When a useful lead exists but it still does not answer the question, call userQuote with isNearAnswer: true. Near-answers must trail every confirmed answer cluster and be grouped under a context that explicitly explains the missing info and why the following quotes might still help.`,
      `4. Context usage: A context always precedes the cluster it describes, stays concise (one sentence or question), and never repeats the entire original question verbatim unless needed for clarity.`,
      `5. Separators: Use separators sparingly between clearly distinct clusters. Do not surround single quotes with separators.`,
      `6. Message hygiene: Skip duplicate quotes. Prefer shorter, on-topic messages. Every messageId must exist in the supplied data.`,

      `Planning steps:`,
      `A. Silently decide the question facets and the 1–3 best direct-answer messages per facet (include prompting messages when needed).`,
      `B. Assemble the sequence in the order it should appear: context → userQuote+ (→ separator → context → userQuote+)*.`,
      `C. If no direct answers exist but near-answers do, produce a single context explaining the gap followed by the near-answer quotes marked isNearAnswer: true.`,
      `D. If absolutely nothing helps, emit no calls.`,
