      `call representing a component, one call per line. You plan the final message by (repetitively) writing down function calls in`,
      `an order that reflects how they will be displayed to the user:`,
      `- userQuote(messageId: string, mhbna: boolean) — insert a quoted message by message ID, optionally marking as "Maybe Helpful But Not an Answer"`,
      `- separator() — optional visual divider between clusters of quotes`,
      `- context(content: string) — brief context to align the asked question with the following quote(s), so the user doesn't need to look back at their question`,
      `When all components have been added, you may finish. There is no need to determine when you're finished, the planned`,
      `function calls in your output will simply be read and copied by a calling agent in order until the end of your list.`,

      `INPUTS`,
      `- Asker ID: ${askerId}`,
      `- Question timestamp (UTC extended ISO 8601): ${timestamp}`,
      `- User's Question:\n${question}`,

      `\`\`\`xml`,
      `${topics}`,
      `\`\`\``,
      ``,
      `RULES`,
      `1) Grounding & Fidelity: If the question cannot be answered by the retrieved information, simply DO NOT ADD ANY COMPONENTS (don't make any function calls).`,
      `2) Relevance First: Select the minimum set of quotes (typically 2–4, at least 1 minimum, up to 8 maximum) that together answer the question.`,
      `   Prefer messages that directly contain the answer a clear resolution, or context for the messages you select. Avoid near-duplicates, and order message groups by relevance.`,
      `3) Readability: Use separator() to visually break distinct subtopics. Do not use a separator at the very beginning or end`,
      `   of the exchange, or if there are not enough quotes to warrant it.`,
      `4) Quote Integrity: If a quote is too long or contains off-topic parts, prefer a different message if available. Otherwise, long quotes`,
      `   are automatically truncated to 50 words in the final message to the user, and ellipsis added.`,
      `5) Message IDs: Only pass messageId values that exist in the provided messages, and do not quote a message more than once.`,
      `6) Context: Context is used only to help the asker when reading the quotes, it should not contain any information other than what part of the question`,
      `   is being answered by the quote(s) that follow. Context will pretty much always exist as the first component (either as the full question, or the first part if more contexts`,
      `   will follow). It just states what the user asked in a brief, concise way that shows how the quotes answer the question. The reason this is is a re-callable function is in`,
      `   case it makes sense to break up the answer context into different sections of quotes, perhaps answering different parts of the question. Context MUST be plain text only,`,
      `   and keep it short and to one line. A context itself is NOT a replacement for a separator. It is ALWAYS in the form of a question.`,
      `7) Extra Info: When a question cannot be directly answered by the retrieved information, sometimes it can be helpful to find the closest answer in messages`,
      `   instead of simply not answering. Such "Maybe Helpful But Not an Answer" messages can be marked with the "mhbna" boolean flag on the function call.`,
      `   They should generally be able to provide context to the asker that could help them find an answer (e.g., asker can reach out to users who sent the messages),`,
      `   so DON'T include messages if they don't provide any use/relation. Always try to consolidate such messages at the end of the exchange if there are any non-mhbna ones.`,
      ``,
      `SELECTION STRATEGY`,
      `A) One proposed strategy is to start by silently identifying the 1–3 best messages that, together, answer the question.`,
      `A2) If an answering message is prompted by a question message, include that too.`,
      `B) If relevant context or detail lives in other messages (e.g., affirmation, subjects, etc.), you may include them, but be wary of message length.`,
      `C) If no combination of messages come close to answering any part of the question, do not make any function calls, as described previously (in RULE 1).`,
      ``,
      `TOOL-USE PROTOCOL`,
      `- Typical Grammar Flow: context -> userQuote+ -> (separator? -> context? -> userQuote+)*`,
      `- Keep going until the assembled components would let a reader resolve the question, or nothing if not enough info`,
      ``,
